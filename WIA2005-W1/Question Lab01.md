## 										QUESTIONS



1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a
  message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

2. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out
  an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react
  differently when divided by 2?

3. Take a list, say for example this one:

  > a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  
  and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

4. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the
  divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides
  evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no
  remainder.)

5. Take two lists, say for example these two:

  > a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  > 
  > b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

  and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common
  between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of
  different sizes.

6. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A
  **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

7. Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
  Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even
  elements of this list in it.

8. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. ( Hint: Ask for player plays (using
  input),compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the
  players want to start a new game)

  > Remember the rules:
  > 
  > ● Rock beats scissors
  > 
  > ● Scissors beats paper
  > 
  > ● Paper beats rock

9. Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess
  the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

10. Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.

11. Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and
    makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write
    this code inside a function.

12. Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then
    generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make
    sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint:
    The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the
    sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks
    like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)

13. Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the
    elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

14. Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple
    words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.

    > For example, say I type the string:
    > 
    > My name is Michele
    > 
    > Then I would see the string:
    > 
    > Michele is name My

    shown back to me.

15. Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords -
    strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and
    symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the
    user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
